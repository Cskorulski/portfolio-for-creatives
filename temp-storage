          <p class="max-text-width">A Playground page is often a scattered grid of half-finished projects, random ideas, personal experiments, and rejected work we don’t usually get to see in a polished portfolio. It’s the space where the rules don’t apply—you don’t need to fit a brief, explain your process, or curate what stays and what goes.</p>
          <p class="max-text-width">This is the low-pressure zone.</p>
          <p class="max-text-width">If you’re feeling unsure about sharing your work, start with a Play page.</p>
          <p class="max-text-width">It’s a space for dreams and ideas still finding their footing.</p>
